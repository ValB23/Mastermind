## Presentation

Since I couldn't find a version of the Mastermind game after 2010 that was NOT using Flash, I decided to make my own using HTML, CSS, JS and PHP, without any other external libraries aside from JQuery.

Since I have not seen much Mastermind games online aside from some (very) old flash versions, I decided to make my own to experiment.
