## Presentation

Since I couldn't find a version of the Mastermind game after 2010 that was NOT using Flash, I decided to make my own using HTML, CSS, JS and PHP, without any other external libraries aside from JQuery.

## Why making it?

I decided to make it since the Mastermind game can be challenging and entertaining for all kinds of audience, whether it is with a physical media or a digital one.

## How does it work?

The main game is contained within the index.php file, the ajax.php file is there to update the guessing history and display the (in)correct symbols.
